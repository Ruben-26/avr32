/** Assertion implementation function.
 *
 *  All CUnit assertions reduce to a call to this function. It should only be called during an active test run (checked by assertion). This means that CUnit assertions should only be used in registered test functions during a test run.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *  bValue		Value of the assertion (TRUE or FALSE).
 *  uiLine		Line number of failed test statement.
 *  strCondition			String containing logical test that failed.
 *  strFile	Source file where test statement failed.
 *  strFunction	Function where test statement failed.
 *  bFatal		TRUE to abort test (via longjmp()), FALSE to continue test.
 *  Returns:
 *  As a convenience, returns the value of the assertion.
